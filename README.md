PinPoint
========

**PinPoint is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to makes notes on particular points in a video so you can revisit them later with ease.**

## Create PinPoints on any YouTube video
- Hover your cursor over the video to bring up the Sidebar and create a PinPoint
- Move your cursor away from the video to hide the Sidebar and see your videos as normal
- PinPoints can be made in the default YouTube player or the full-screen player.

## PinPoints automatically load when you revisit a video
- The Sidebar will display all PinPoints for that video you've already made

## Includes a full-page Dashboard to see your PinPoint videos
- A visually appealing and organized way to see your favorite videos

## Easy to Disable
- Not taking notes? Simply click 'off' in the PinPoint extension pop-up until you're ready to use it again.
